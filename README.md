# React + Vite

This is a demo website which will serve as a base or foundation for the ecommerce site that we will have to build at the end
of the year. 

Every week I will be building a part of the website. If i come upon any dificulties. I'll comment them and explain 
what exactly is giving me trouble. If needed I'll take even longer to get what i need exactly.

The Aim : Finish E-commerce website before the end of the year. with everything functioning alright and with a backend that 
works properly.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
